# Host Utilization & Energy Calculation Using Cloudsim 

In this repository I implemented an algorith where VMs are migrated to over utilized host and transferred to under utilized host which results in quicker response time.

```
A host's over utilization ratio = 85% and 

A host's under utilized if utilization ratio = 45%
```

The sample console output has been attached in the ```log.txt``` file.

### How to run
Import the file ```HostUtilizationExample``` in the working directory of cloudsim/example and run as usual.
